# Coding-Journal


The Coding Journal App is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to register, log in, and manage a personal collection of coding problems they’ve solved or want to track. Each user can **create, read, update, delete (CRUD)** their own problems securely using **JWT authentication**.
